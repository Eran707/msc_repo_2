# Model of neuronal chloride homeostasis (multiple compartments)

## Figures 7 and 8 of the paper "Biophysical models reveal the relative importance of transporter proteins and impermeant anions in chloride homeostasis" by DÃ¼sterwald, Currin, Burman, Akerman, Kay and Raimondo

Multi-compartmental model of a neuron with multiple ion species, including chloride and impermeant anions. The latter figures in the paper (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/08/216150) are demonstrated in the notebook "runme_figures_7_and_8" in this repo.
